# Wordle
A small game of wordle I created in C. I will soon be updating it with a proper proper dictionary for a better puzzle experience. May have some bugs?
Need to have command line knowledge in Windows or UNIX to run the code. 
Method 1:
1) Navigate to the file in the terminal where you save the wordle file
2) Open the file in the terminal

Method 2:
1) Save the wordle.c file
2) Navigate to the file using the terminal
3) Call in the command
   $- gcc wordle.c -o wordle
4) And then ./wordle
5) If gcc is not installed enter the following command in the terminal
   $- sudo apt gcc install
